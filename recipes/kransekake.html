      <h2>What is Kransekake?</h2>
      <p>Kransekake is a traditional Danish and Norwegian dessert made of cookie-like cake rings that are layered in concentric rings to form a cone-shaped cake. The layers are "glued" together with sugary icing. Made with ground almonds, egg whites, and confectioners' sugar, kransekake has a light texture and nutty flavor that's impossible to resist.</p>

      <h2>Kransekake Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground almonds</strong>: Both blanched (almonds with their skins removed) and unblanched ground almonds are necessary for this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg whites</strong>: No yolks are needed for this light and airy kransekake recipe! Three egg whites go into the cake and one goes into the icing.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: A teaspoon of lemon juice enhances the overall flavor of the icing and adds subtle brightness.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A dash of vanilla extract is another subtle flavor enhancer for the 4-ingredient icing.</li>
      </ul>
